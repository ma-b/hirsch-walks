# hirsch-walks

This repository provides tools for the study of paths on polyhedra. These tools have been developed to analyze known counterexamples to the [Hirsch conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hirsch_conjecture), which claimed a certain upper bound on the number of edges one needs to walk from any vertex of a given polyhedron to any other one. 

The code is written in [Sage](https://www.sagemath.org/) and [Julia](https://julialang.org/).
See here for the theoretical results that the authors of the code obtained.
